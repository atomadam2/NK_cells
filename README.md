# NK_cells
This is a repository of R scripts used for my NK-cell publication

NK_Cell_Figures.R - This is an R script that will pull in the other files and create the figures used in the manuscript (Figures 1 and 2). The single cell data requires an R object that I created in a previous manuscript. The code for that cane be found in another repository (atomadam2/PBMC_AH_LPS_scRNA-seq). But, because this is a lot of work, I can share this useable R object if you contact me.


NK_CD8_Basal_DOWN.csv - This file is a list of all genes DOWN regulated by LPS in NK cells and CD8 T-cells.
NK_CD8_Basal_UP.csv - This file is a list of all genes UP regulated by LPS in NK cells and CD8 T-cells.
All_genes.csv - This file contains a list of genes used for the correlation studies, and include a long list of genes found to be either highly expressed in NK cells or highly differentially expressed between sAH and HC or Basal and LPS.
